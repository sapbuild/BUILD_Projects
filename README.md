# Exposed API Calls
```sh
[GET, POST, PUT] /api/projects/
[GET] /api/projects/?showArchived=true|false
```
- JSON response containing all projects associated with the users profile
- Supported filters [?showArchived=true|false], return a list of projects filtered by the archive flag. If flag is omitted you receive ALL projects
- to archive a project, you call PUT, passing in the following body '{"archived":true}', similar to how you would update the project and its respective fields.

```sh
[DELETE] /api/projects/:projectId/revoke
```
- Allowing the owner of the project ONLY to revoke certain items i.e. invited users

```sh
[POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE] /api/projects/:projectId/invite
```
- Allowing the user to accept, reject and create invites for a project
- ACL is only on POST, there is no ACL on the PUT, PATCH and DELETE as user wont be a collaborator on the project as we wont have their user ID to apply to ACL

```sh
[GET] /api/projects/:projectId/team
```
- Return a JSON response of all team members of a project i.e. Rejected User, Invite List and Collaborators
- User must be a member of the project in order to carry out any of these tasks

```sh
[GET] /api/projects/:projectId/
[PUT, PATCH, DELETE] /api/projects/:projectId/settings
```
- JSON response containing specific project details
- ACL is enforced to owner to update, archive or delete a project

[GET] /api/projects/:projectId/document/?thumbOnly=true|false [default is false]
[POST] /api/projects/:projectId/document/?linkImage=true [default is false]
```
- Upload and retrieve files belonging to a specific project
- Supported filters [?fileType=image/png, thumbOnly=true|false], these can be combined in one request as well
- Append linkImage=true to the POST if you want to attach a thumbnail to the main image. This thumbnail needs to be uploaded/created by the UI client, it is not created on the server. Setting this attribute to true will populate the parent_id in the thumbnail.

```sh
[GET] /api/projects/:projectId/document/:assetId/
[GET] /api/projects/:projectId/document/:assetId/?thumbOnly=true|false
